Covid-19 Awareness Site
I developed a responsive Covid-19 awareness website using JavaScript to ensure optimal content display across various devices. The site features an intuitive user interface, designed for seamless navigation and accessibility, regardless of screen size. Emphasizing the importance of clear and effective communication, the front-end development focused on delivering vital information about Covid-19 in a user-friendly manner. This project highlights my commitment to creating accessible web solutions that provide crucial information efficiently and attractively.
